As per the Ministry of HRD norms, the sanctioned strength of non-faculty is based on the ratio of students:Faculty:non-faculty  i.e. 10:1:1.1. 3. There is no option in a drop-down list box for our Institute programmes  MHRM and MMST and that is why we have chosen MHRD in place of MHRM and Master of Science in Medical MicroBiology in place of MMST.4. Total time duration for the PhD programme is 8 years and for MS if 5 years. When we put 8 in the intake part, 1 corresponding row is created in the enrollment part. It is o.k..  Similarly when we put 5 in the intake part against MS then 5 corresponding rows are created in the enrollment part. It is not o.k.. That is why against MS we have always given 1 in place of 5.5. Professor of the Mechanical Engineering department holds a position of Deputy Director. There is no option for Deputy Director in a drop-down list box. That is why we have chosen Director.Some new departments/centers/schools have no faculty as on 30.07.2015.We have put 0 in the sanctioned strength column of the staff group-wise as we simply calculate sanctioned strength based on 10:1:1.1 of the total students strength as on 30.7.2015.","22.3302009999999989","87.3237009999999998","103212","","true","false","false","true","721302","false","0","false","","false"

Ratan Shastri decorated with Padma Bhushan by President of India and honoured with Jamnalal Bajaj award for her service to the cause of womens education. The institution is known world over for its dedication to the noble cause of women education and was declared as an institution deemed to be university in 1983. While NAAC has re-accredited Banasthali Vidyapith at the highest possible grade A level in 2011 the Review Committee Tandon Committee of Ministry of HRD also appreciated the overall efforts of Vidyapith in areas of Institutional Governance Academic Achievements Research Student Progression Infrastructure etc. and categorized Banasthali Vidyapith under  Category A list of Institutions deemed to be university in the year 2010. Furthermore a rigorous All India Universities Survey by AC Nielsen India Today ranked Vidyapith at I position on basis of factual data in 2012.If aspects like exclusive dedication to women education fully residential character rural surrounding amidst its own unmatchable campus of 850 acres range of courses from Nursery to Ph.D. national representation of students, focus on Indian ethos & culture are considered in totality than there is no institution like Banasthali Vidyapith in the entire country. It is encouraging to note that that the ex-Governor of Gujarat Smt. Kamla Beniwal,  ex-Speaker of Loksabha Smt. Meira Kumar, Asian Marathon Champion Ms. Sunita Godara, Director-HR of WWF Ms. Shivani Wadhwa and Director-HR of Metro Cash & Carry, Dr.Saagarika Ghosal are among our alumnae.","26.4039070000000002","75.8807659999999942","112179","","true","false","true","true","304022","false","0","true","6303","false"
